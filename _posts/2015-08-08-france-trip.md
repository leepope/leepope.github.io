#### _Original Post_

I'm going to France! After dreaming about this trip since I was old enough to ride a bike, I'm
going to spend a month on my bike in the Pyrenees and Alps. Lots of people have been asking about
my itinerary, so I'll record it here, and update with links to the actual rides when I return home.

<!--more-->

### Aug 16-20 [Paris-Brest-Paris](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris%E2%80%93Brest%E2%80%93Paris)
This is *The* Grand Randonnee - 1200 kilometers from Paris to the Britanny coast and back. It's older than Le
Tour, and hasn't been run as a race since 1951, but there will be upwards of
4000 riders leaving Paris.

### Aug 23-26 [Raid Pyreneen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raid_Pyr%C3%A9n%C3%A9en)
461 miles, 50,000 feet of climbing, 100 hours.

This is a *Permanent* brevet, run by a local group. Instead of a bunch of cyclists coming for an event, the
curators send you a map and a card with instructions like "get a stamp at such
and such a hotel," or "here's the combination to a lock on top of whozit pass -
there's a stamp inside; punch your card." This route is one I've looked forward
to forever.

Legendary climbs like the [Col d'Aubisque](http://velopeloton-cycling-pyrenees.bike/col-daubisque/), the [Col de
Peyresourde](http://velopeloton-cycling-pyrenees.bike/col-de-peyresourde/), and the [Col de Tourmalet](http://velopeloton-cycling-pyrenees.bike/col-du-tourmalet/)

Due to the demands of the rest of the trip, I'm going to attempt this on a
touring bike, self supported. We'll see if I can make the time cutoff....

### Aug 28-Sept 1 Mediterranean and Provence

Time for a break! 270 miles, not much climbing until the last day when I head
into Provence.

I don't really have an itinerary here, just need to get from
Cerebere to Mt. Ventoux by Sept 1. Should be some beach days in here, hopefully
some hammock time.

### Sept 2 [Mt Ventoux](http://www.veloventoux.com/?c=montVentoux)

There is a permanent brevet on Mt Ventoux; ride to the top by all three paved
roads in 24 hours, and you get a medal! If you add the "Forest Road," you get
a different medal. It means starting at 3 AM, and about 20,000 feet of climbing,
but who knows when I'll be back.

And I'm a big fan of forests.

Ummmm....

At least there's a good tan waiting!

### Sept 4-6 Barcelonette

I may end up skipping this one in favor of the next leg to Bourg d'Oisans, but
there are some great climbs here.

### Sept 7-9 Les Bourg d'Oisans

![Glandon Hairpins](/images/glandon_hairpins.jpg)

This is a little town at the foot of Alpe d'Huez, and there are so many
incredible climbs here, I wish I could stay for a month!

[Alpe d'Huez](http://www.cycling-challenge.com/alpe-dhuez-five-different-rides/)

The [Col de Sarenne](http://www.cycling-challenge.com/col-de-la-sarenne-auris-and-maronne/)

[Col de Galibier](http://www.cycling-challenge.com/col-du-galibier-a-complete-look/)

[Col de la Croix de Fer](http://www.cycling-challenge.com/col-du-galibier-a-complete-look/)
and the Col de Glandon

I may just decide to to [La Marmotte](http://www.cycling-challenge.com/2010-la-marmotte-success/), depending on the time available.
