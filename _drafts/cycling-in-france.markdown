### Things I love about Cycling in France

* People love cyclists. On Paris-Brest-Paris, there were families standing out
  by the road with goodies and hot drinks well after dark, asking nothing more
  than a postcard for their time. I met an 80 year-old outside of [WHAT WAS THE
  NAME?] at 3AM, serving coffee simply because it was bitter cold and he wanted
  to meet riders. I met a bunch of guys in the rain, 50km fro the finish - they
  were relatives of a rider who had finished a few hours before. He was there as
  well, cheering for the riders behind him.

  Keep in mind that I was one of the later riders by this point - these folks
  weren't there to see the fast people, but the regular riders who were
  suffering.

* Drivers respect cyclists. In one month of riding, and almost 3000 miles, even
  riding in Paris, I had *one* unpleasant incident, where a car passed me too
  close for comfort (at a distance that seems to be the default for American
  drivers!). I regularly had people follow for hundreds of meters in the
  mountains, waiting for a place where they could safely pass.

  I attribute part of this to the fact that driving in the countryside often
  results in waiting; for tractors or livestock. Nobody leaves home expecting to
  arrive at a particular time; the drive is an adventure, and cyclists are no
  more a delay than a flock of sheep. People will roll down the window and yell,
  but it's to congratulate, not vituperate.
